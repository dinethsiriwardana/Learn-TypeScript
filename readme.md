In this branch, there are 3 TypeScript files: main.ts, main2.ts, and main3.ts.

main.ts
This file demonstrates the use of generics in TypeScript. The addId function uses a generic type T to allow for flexibility in the data type of the object passed in as an argument. The UserInterface interface defines a required name property for objects that implement it.

main2.ts
This file demonstrates the use of a generic type constraint. The addId_2 function uses a generic type T that extends the object type to ensure that only objects are passed in as arguments. The UserInterface_2 interface defines a required name property for objects that implement it.

main3.ts
This file demonstrates the use of generics with interfaces. The addId_3 function uses a generic type T that extends the object type to ensure that only objects are passed in as arguments. The UserInterface_3 interface defines a required name property and a generic data property that can be of any type. The UserInterface_3_2 interface demonstrates passing in multiple generic types to an interface.

Overall, these TypeScript files demonstrate the use of generics and generic type constraints in TypeScript.
